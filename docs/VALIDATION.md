# Manual validation

ProMeter reconstructs usage from ChatGPT account history. These checks require a real signed-in Pro account.

## Multi-device

1. On this PC, open the tray flyout and note the GPT Pro count.
2. On the Android ChatGPT app, send one GPT-5.6 Sol Pro or GPT-6 Pro message.
3. On this PC, choose **Sync now**.
4. Confirm the Pro counter increases by 1.

## Another PC

1. Use ChatGPT on a second Windows PC with the same account.
2. Sync on the machine running ProMeter.
3. Confirm the remote usage appears.

## Reasoning

1. In ChatGPT, send one GPT-5.6 Sol message with Extra High (`매우 높음`).
2. Sync.
3. Confirm **SOL REASONING → Extra High** increases by 1.
4. Confirm the Pro meter does **not** increase for non-Pro Sol reasoning.

## Regenerate

1. Send one Pro message.
2. Regenerate the response.
3. Sync.
4. If the conversation endpoint returns every branch `request_id`, the Pro count should increase by 1 for the regenerate.
5. If only the current branch is returned, Coverage should stay Estimated/Good and this limitation should remain visible.

## Archive

1. Use Pro in a chat, then archive that chat.
2. Sync.
3. Confirm the current-period Pro count still includes that usage.

## Project

1. Send a Pro message inside a ChatGPT Project.
2. Sync.
3. Confirm the event appears and Coverage lists Projects as available.

## Temporary / deleted

1. Use Temporary Chat or delete a conversation.
2. Confirm those turns do **not** appear after sync.
3. Coverage should continue to list Temporary and Deleted as unavailable.

## Official export

1. From ChatGPT Settings → Data Controls, download `conversations.json` if available.
2. Import it from ProMeter Settings.
3. Import the same file again.
4. Confirm usage counts do not double.
